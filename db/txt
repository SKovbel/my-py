ACID compliance is a set of database characteristics consisting of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability
that ensure that database transactions are completed efficiently.
If a database fulfills the aspects of ACID compliance, it is known to be ACID-compliant.

1NF (First Normal Form) Rules
- Each table cell should contain a single value.
- Each record needs to be unique.
(unique/primary key can be complex)

= a single cell must not hold more than one value (atomicity)
= there must be a primary key for identification
= no duplicated rows or columns
= each column must have only one value for each row in the table

2NF (Second Normal Form) Rules
- Be in 1NF
- Single Column Primary Key /that does not functionally dependant on any subset of candidate key relation/
(primary key must be single column key)

3NF (Third Normal Form) Rules
- Be in 2NF
- Has no transitive functional dependencies

BCNF

4NF 
- It should be in the Boyce-Codd Normal Form.
- And, the table should not have any Multi-valued Dependency.
