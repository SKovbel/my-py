ResNet (Residual Networks): ResNet is known for its deep architecture with residual blocks, which helps mitigate 
the vanishing gradient problem. It has variants like ResNet-50, ResNet-101, etc.

VGGNet (Visual Geometry Group Network): VGGNet has a simple and uniform architecture with small filters, 
making it easy to understand and implement. It comes in different versions like VGG16 and VGG19.

Inception (GoogLeNet): The Inception architecture uses multiple filters at each layer, 
allowing the model to capture information at different scales. InceptionV3 is a popular variant.

MobileNet: MobileNet is designed for resource-constrained devices and applications. 
It uses depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and computational cost.

EfficientNet: EfficientNet is an architecture that scales the depth, width, and resolution of the network to find
 an optimal balance between model size and performance.

DenseNet: DenseNet connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. 
It encourages feature reuse and helps in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.

ResNeXt: ResNeXt is an extension of ResNet that introduces a cardinality parameter, 
allowing the model to learn more diverse and richer features.

YOLO (You Only Look Once): YOLO is a real-time object detection system that divides an image into a grid
 and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly.

Faster R-CNN: Faster R-CNN is a region-based convolutional neural network for object detection. 
It uses a region proposal network (RPN) to generate region proposals.

SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector): SSD is another object detection model that predicts bounding boxes 
and class scores for multiple object scales in a single forward pass.
