# ImageNet is a large-scale visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research.
# It contains millions of labeled images in thousands of categories.
# The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) is a well-known competition that has played a significant role in advancing the field of computer vision.
# Many deep learning models for image classification, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been trained and benchmarked on the ImageNet dataset.
